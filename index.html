  <h1> Rimpy Saini "A beginning coder"</h1>
   <img src="rimpy.JPG" alt="Me">
   <p> My name is Rimpy Saini. I have done masters in <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology" target="_blank">biotechnology</a>. I was working
    with a multinational company as <strong>"Pharmacovigilance Associate and Trainer"</strong>. I have a lot of interest in genetics and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunology" target="_blank"> immunology </a>.
     Apart from that I like playing chess and badminton.
    I also like listening to music.</p>

    <h2> Benefits of learning coding</h2>
    <p>
      There are number of reasons as to why we should learn coding....
      <div>
      <ol>
        <li>You'll be able to fine-tune your site's blogposts or even your whole theme</li>
        <li>You'd have the options of using a faster & safer 'static CMS'</li>
        <li>You can build your own landing pages</li>
        <li>You can rummage through other sites' code to see how it all works</li>
        <li>You could work more effectively with digital designers and developers</li>
        <li>You'll have more confidence, and might end up in an <strong>entirely new career</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </p>

<h2> Experience as a coder </h2>
  <p> At first I was a bit scared, as this was a new field altogether for me but later when I started
    learning HTML and CSS I  got interested in this and I found it to be easy and fun.
    But But But.....
    When we started with Java in week three, it again shook my confidence but I hope with a lot more effort
    I will be able to cope with this as well.
    It's really <strong>interesting and fun </strong> to see how we can design our website and play around it with
    so many stylings.
